Leejai Flowers. Non-binary vampire, irritable and pessimistic, takes their moods out on objects and the occasional pirate ship.

They have done and will do a lot of incredible stuff but they're *blas√©* about it. They've hit one of the low points of the immortal life a few centuries ago when they were booted out of New Eden, and they never got back on their feet.

They can't keep a job under someone else's direction because of their bad attitude, so they founded Cargo Space Deliveries. They suck at their job but they know a lot of people in a grey area and they do a lot of black market stuff. Off-the-shelves synthetic human blood is hard to come by, after all.

1-9 hello flowers

4 talk to max, they get busted for parting spaceship in wrong spot, take regular cargo and set destination to system

5 we see inside of spaceship, living quarters, holo forest, they find out felinopod is gov official

6 it seems shadier and shadier as the feline gov is rocked and feline agent is found dead, time for a pit stop at a junk orbital diner

7 eating, shady people shadowing them, recieves a text from muinn (part-time girlfriend)

8 back to the ship, doesn't notice being tailed because muinn, decrypts and sends teletext back, laments her being so antitech

9 special chap : muinn in the forest (same as holo forest but more real), maybe some q&a or games ?

10-18 charming cat prince

octavia calls : her clone likely talked which triggered death, leejai is locked in, prince needs to succeed but regent is serious about killing him and only the heirloom can protect him. she loves the prince, knows it will take an immortal to bring him his heirloom, too much pride in fellow felinopod killers (she's a bit of a bitch)

leejai realises they're being followed and tries a bullet dodge : manually starting hyperspeed without scanning for obstacles, ends up going through a cloud that shuts down some of the ship, air leaks.

assailants catch leejai as they're getting hauled to a nearby garage, she fries them with giant laser.

as they get nearer, the attacks get stronger. plot twist, octavia works for the regent so the prince is just biologically attacked by whatever was in the box when leejai delivers it. the prince army is massacred.

they've been screwed with. teletex from muinn who says not to take things too far and come home, but they boards a feline destroyer on a revenge mission : just offing octavia and the regent by drinking them to death.

end of part one

stupid on many levels: feels very guilty, country rioting and possibly at war is not better off, hunt for a feeder (scifi people eater) is up again (feeders are feared like sociopaths, it's the individual not the species...)

relationship trouble with muinn who said no killing and resents wrongly placed ambitions for leejai

but golden city calls and leejai is back in the game, leaving muinn on the feeling she's gonna leave them

leejai secretely hopes they can go back to golden city but the person who contacted them didn't even know their history with it
