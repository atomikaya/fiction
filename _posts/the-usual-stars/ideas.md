Leejai Flowers. Non-binary vampire, irritable and pessimistic, takes their moods out on objects and the occasional pirate ship.

They have done and will do a lot of incredible stuff but they're *blasé* about it. They've hit one of the low points of the immortal life a few centuries ago when they were booted out of New Eden, and they never got back on their feet.

They can't keep a job under someone else's direction because of their bad attitude, so they founded Cargo Space Deliveries. They suck at their job but they know a lot of people in a grey area and they do a lot of black market stuff. Off-the-shelves synthetic human blood is hard to come by, after all.


prologue:

a fish alien is on a vacation and enjoys the frozen nitrogen outdoor pool from inside their fish tank space suit.

they talk to someone remotely. light mood, not very bright tourist.

they get out, admire the view and spot Leejai. panic, they get out screaming and calling for help. they think they've seen a body.

Leejai feels the tremors and it shakes them awake, we see that they're alive.

“I'm frozen stiff!” they think. “I must have fallen asleep. Well, better get going!”
