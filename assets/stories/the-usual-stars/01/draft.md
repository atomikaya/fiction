Flablo, a middle-aged biome pescian salesman on a break.

Leejai, the protagonist.

view from outer space. we are above a small holiday resort in an asteroid field. No (much) sun in sight.

*some clever words of intro* while we zoom in on the resort's outside pool, made of whatever substance could still be liquid in the void of space. it fumes like hot springs.

an automatic hatch opens and we see and hear Flablo talking on a videophone. He's the only one who can hear himself (because space).

> I know, Daslan, that's why I told him: you wanna make it span a valley, you're looking at Golden Hub's capacity of investment in biome renovation. Yeah. Right. Well, he turned purple. Yeah, those Teishuejn, right?

he hops into the bath. his suit adapts and gives info on composition and temperature. he sights in pleasure.

> Yeah, I don't know, you flounder. You ask *him*. Anyway it's a shame you couldn't be here, we have an amazing view of a something that's aah…

we see it, a cloud of something, a nebulae or a miniature galaxy or something. maybe mixed with northern lights.

> … Not sure what it is but it's beautiful. Quite the light show.

He enjoys his bath, flaps around, plays throwing waves in space. He's more listening than talking now, and getting bored in a very matter-of-fact way.

> Yeah, sure. Well. We'll talk at the office. Have a fruitful cycle too.
