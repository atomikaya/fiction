Flablo, a middle-aged biome pescian salesman on a break.

Leejai, the protagonist.

view from outer space. we are above a small holiday resort in an asteroid field. No (much) sun in sight.

*some clever words of intro* while we zoom in on the resort's outside pool, made of whatever substance could still be liquid in the void of space. it fumes like hot springs.

an automatic hatch opens and we see and hear Flablo talking on a videophone. He's the only one who can hear himself (because space).

> I know, Daslan, that's why I told him: you wanna make it span a valley, you're looking at Golden Hub's capacity of investment in biome renovation. Yeah. Right. Well, he turned purple. Yeah, those Teishuvejn, right?

he hops into the bath. his suit adapts and gives info on composition and temperature. he sights in pleasure.

> Yeah, I don't know, you flounder. You ask *him*. Anyway it's a shame you couldn't be here, we have an amazing view of a something that's aah…

we see it, a cloud of something, a nebulae or a miniature galaxy or something. maybe mixed with northern lights.

> … Not sure what it is but it's beautiful. Quite the light show.

He enjoys his bath, flaps around, plays throwing waves in space. He's more listening than talking now, and getting bored in a very matter-of-fact way.

> Yeah, sure. Well. We'll talk at the office. Yeah. Have a fruitful cycle too.

He makes a sort of snapping gesture to close communication and relaxes, even going 'underwater' for a time. We look through his eyes at the beautiful landscape. Soon he can't stand the silence and he starts a fission jazz mix. He notices a holo sign indicating view of the nitric falls. When he goes there he finds a shape crouched on the ground, its face iced over. It backs of running.

> Security! Someone help, there's a flappin' dead body in the pool area!

Some rocks fly in low gravity, one of the hits the body, Leejai. They wake up.

> What?

They realize they're frozen stiff and the work it out, breaking the ice and shaking out flakes.

> Shit, I must have fallen asleep. I'm stiff as hell!

They get up and look at the scenery. They unpack a bag of blood and auto warm it. It comes with a couple straws in it. They drink it to get warmer.

> Vacation asteroids, man. Not really my thing.

They look at a holo watch.

> I just hope that package will make it on time.
