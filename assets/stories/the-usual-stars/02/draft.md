Octavia, a mysterious octocat.

Flablo flees screaming, we're still on the iced over Leejai.

> @leejay : (still not here ?)

The ice breaks and Leejai emerges. They can't speak cause void of space and no speaker but they think out loud ;D

Leejai is on the edge of the nitric falls, waiting for its mysterious visitor.

> @leejai : Maybe I should just go? This meeting seems a lot shadier than the paycheck implied.

They're visibly annoyed and rub their arms in order not to freeze again.

> It's been half a hour already. Uuh, I wish I hadn't pawned my void suit.

We zoom out from them and onto a cliff where a sort of drone is waiting. Someone is riding it like a bike. They go down and land near Leejai. They have seen them coming already.

They're like a sort of octopus cat : eight legs, no fur, big head, stealthy. Leejai activates their earpiece.

> You're late.

> I was waiting for the others to leave. Couldn't you have worn a suit like everyone else? You're attracting attention.

The octocat is displeased, slightly haughty. Leejai feels just as nice.

> I'm part of a shipping service, not a spy agency and I'm on a budget. I'm not going over my fees because you want me to dress up.

The octocat shows a small package, the size of a big book.

> Well. Anyway. This needs to be delivered before two days to Ash Grozenfeld of the Itnis Peninsula. The details are on the box.

> Yeah, that's what parcels are for. Anything else? Why didn't you just go through a mainstream mail service if what you need is speed?

> I need speed *and* discretion.

> Just so we're clear: someone official asks questions, I answer. If you're looking for a smuggler, you have the wrong person.

The octocat looks at them, sizing them up.

> Are you Leejai Flowers?

> Yes.

> Then I have the right person. Handle this with care.

Intermingled, we see the octocat flying away on its drone bike and Leejai going back inside the station.
