max and leejai

some impossible floating geometry stuff for max's office

1. leejai gets through the phone and on the other side, max is surprised cause xe thought they were only gonna window
  - oh, hey, what gives?
  - just chilling with muinn, I thought this talk would go better in your office
  - you bet
2. max spills the beans, gets documents out
  - I found out quite a lot about your mystery client. didn't care much about hiding, apparently.
  - is that good news, like she has nothing to hide?
3. max shakes xis head.
  - wait until you hear. the girl is Octavia Mewman - a celebrity back in her kingdom. former high minister.
  - her kingdom?
  - yeah, occupying something like five planets top, but still.
4.
  - this makes no sense. why would she come to me?
  - better question, what's in your package?
  - you know there's a continuum lock on those things.
  - then all we can do is guess, or try and contact her directly.
5.
  - you think she'll answer?
  - who knows... oh, wait. this is bad.
  - what?
6. we slowly switch to what they're talking about
  - there are news of an military coup on Whiska-4. Like, two hours ago.
7.
  - the prime minister is supposedly behind it... there is something about a succession? I don't know. anyway, it's a mess.
  - tell me about it.
8. back to the office
  - do we know if my client has been involved?
  - I have no idea. I need more time to sort the feeds and find the reliable info.
9. we see her dead in the street
  - anyway, you've been paid, right.
  - yeah. I just don't want any of the mess.
