### How / When did you start doing all that?

I've been writing and drawing stuff since I wasâ€¦ Six or seven years old?

For a long time, I kept it to a hobby. I think I was scared of having to 'become good or die' at something I really liked (competition isn't my strong suit). Now I'm done being scared. Comes as a perk for growing older, sometimes. So let's build wonderful worlds together and see what happens!

Thanks for reading me!

### What's going on for now?

Well, I got two books in the writing, expect the first **complete drafts** of *Cock-a-Doodle-Doom* and *Over & Done with* to be done in the first semester of 2017.

In the second semester, It's gonna be time to go back to comics with a story - possibly romance in a web format? I will also add a french section to write my first fantasy novel in french.

I will take suggestions on what projects to pursue.

I'll try to find a time and maybe reserve two to three month to review each of my first two books before publication, but I don't know when that will be. Over all things, I don't want to overload myself and give up, so pacing is important and plans *will* change over time. :)

Stay tuned!
